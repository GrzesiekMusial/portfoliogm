In every company there is a lot of repetitive tasks which have to be done. In my constantly changing, startup environment we didn't have resources for serious integration of all of our systems. As I was interested in python, and preferred to spend time on learning rather than doing the same tasks over and over again, I built a bot with a graphic interface, which creates invoices in Sage, with functionality of sending automatically invoices to the clients. With this tool one person was able to take care of all tasks much faster. ",
